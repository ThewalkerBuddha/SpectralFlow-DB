Neuroimaging Workflow Reference & Encyclopedia

This is to be used as a single source of reference, to track my progress of how the essentials of Neuroimaging are mastered towards the core tools such as FSL, SPM, AFNI, etc. Its a work in progress, unless it clearly denotes its complete and ready.

Purpose
This workbook is now designed as a comprehensive, standalone reference for neuroimaging workflows, covering all major tools (FSL, SPM, AFNI, FreeSurfer, hMRI toolbox, MRS) and modalities (fMRI, qMRI, hMRI, MRS). It is structured to serve as a single encyclopedia that any researcher can consult to understand, learn, and apply neuroimaging analysis techniques end-to-end
