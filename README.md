# SpectralFlow-DB
Practice implementations &amp; tutorials for quantitative MRI and MR spectroscopy (MRS/MRSI/CEST) using public datasets.

spectraflow-practice
A beginner-friendly, fully commented playground for learning quantitative MRI and MR spectroscopy by re-implementing state-of-the-art methods on open datasets.
Currently includes:

Single-voxel MRS processing & quantification (basis simulation, HSVD, LCModel-style fitting)
MRSI reconstruction and metabolite mapping
CEST / APT evaluation pipelines (Lorentzian fitting, MTRasym, AREX, deep learning baselines)
Multi-parametric mapping (VFA T1, MP2RAGE, ME-SE T2, MTsat)
Hands-on notebooks with Big GABA, SLAK, Leeds CEST, and other public datasets

Think of it as a living textbook + code sandbox. Everything is deliberately over-commented and broken into small steps so students and new researchers can understand exactly what’s happening at each stage.
