# SpectralFlow-DB
Practice implementations &amp; tutorials for quantitative MRI and MR spectroscopy (MRS/MRSI/CEST) using public datasets.

spectraflow-practice
A beginner-friendly, fully commented playground for learning quantitative MRI and MR spectroscopy by re-implementing state-of-the-art methods on open datasets.
Currently includes:

Single-voxel MRS processing & quantification (basis simulation, HSVD, LCModel-style fitting)
MRSI reconstruction and metabolite mapping
CEST / APT evaluation pipelines (Lorentzian fitting, MTRasym, AREX, deep learning baselines)
Multi-parametric mapping (VFA T1, MP2RAGE, ME-SE T2, MTsat)
Hands-on notebooks with Big GABA, SLAK, Leeds CEST, and other public datasets

A platform for my own practice (Divakar Budda) of qMRI, hMRI, MRS, MRSI, CEST MRI datasets. 

About me:

I am a PhD candidate finalizing my thesis in Neuropsychopharmacology building mathematical quantitative systems pharmacology models for chronic pain, although the methods can be appied for other disorders as well. I have developed deep passion for non-invasive imaging methods particular qMRI, and MRS and hope to develop workflows to integrate CNS QSP models with non-invasive imaging to optimize treatment of CNS disorders. This repository is to practice skills, towards my goal of integrative workflows. a tiny step each day...
